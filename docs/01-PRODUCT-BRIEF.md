# Product Brief — Wiselista (Property Photo Capture & AI Edit)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Planning  
**Last updated:** Feb 2025

---

## 1. Elevator story

An app that helps **rental property managers, real estate agents, and homeowners** take **good-value property photos** for listings. It provides:

- **Automated framing** by room
- **Virtual tour** (later phase)
- **Coaching tips & guidelines** at capture time
- **AI editing** — photos submitted and returned to the photographer or to a CMS

**People:** Rental Property Management, Real Estate Agents, Home Owners.

---

## 2. The problem

| Stakeholder | Pain |
|-------------|------|
| **Market** | Photographers avoid rental and “non-desirable” properties (lower-end, geo-challenged). |
| **Rental listings** | Non-edited, poor-quality photos → worse outcomes: time to rent, tenant quality, rent value. |
| **Agency owners** | Rentals are critical; relationship with investor-owners and future sales; RPM is business equity. Lower-end owners resist paying for pros; cost often falls on the agent. |

**Current workaround:** Phone photos, unedited, non-professional.

---

## 3. Who it’s for

- **End users (viewers):** Home buyers, renters (see the improved listings).
- **Primary app users:** Real estate agents, rental property management teams, homeowners.
- **Indirect:** Agency owners (efficiency, quality, cost control).

---

## 4. Why now

- **Validation:** Industry leaders (e.g. Barfoot & Thompson, Harcourts Victoria) have indicated willingness to pay and/or fund for their teams.
- **Scale:** Barfoot & Thompson ~5,000 rentals + low-end listings/year; Harcourts Victoria 5,000+ listings/year; Realtor.com 11M rental listings (US).
- **Tech:** AI editing quality and cost are sufficient to make the product viable.

---

## 5. Magic moment

**Photos (and later Virtual Tour) captured in-app → submitted → high-value edited content returned in ~15–20 minutes.**

---

## 6. Success (what it looks like)

- Successful pilots and **case studies** with data on: speed to rent/list, quality, price, time saved.
- Adoption across: **Rentals**, **house sales**, and potential **portal** use.
- **Insight:** Portals vs agencies — portals raise prices claiming “value add”; this can be a real value-add for agencies.
- **Risk:** Portals could acquire or copy.

---

## 7. How it works (high-level)

| Actor | Flow |
|-------|------|
| **Capture client** | Open app → Log in → Place photo in frame by room → Submit. |
| **App** | Store photos by ID → Send to AI edit partner. |
| **AI partner** | Edit → Return / distribute to Capture client. |
| **Support** | Email/call for issues. |

---

---

## 11. V1 scope

### Must-have (V1)

- User identification (auth)
- Photo **frame** capability (by room)
- Capture **shooting tips**
- **Send** to AI edit partner
- **Save** (persist photos/jobs)
- **Notification** when content is ready
- **Pay now** (client direct payment)
- **Secure** (data, access, payments)

### Nice-to-have (later)

- Virtual tour
- Integration with Portals / CMS

---

## 12. What this app is NOT

- **Not** a replacement for professional photographers.
- **Is** an alternative for: rentals, market-entry and geo-challenged housing where pro photography isn’t used.

---

## 13. Deal breakers

- Must be **more than** “photos from a phone” (framing, tips, workflow).
- **AI edit** is essential; product doesn’t work without it.

---

## 14. Data & trust

| Data type | Required? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Personal data | Yes |
| Sensitive data | Not really |
| Location | No |
| Photos | Yes |
| Payments | Yes |

---

## 15. Business model (direction)

Revenue is driven by **convenience**: shoot → get editing → get results in ~15–20 minutes. The value is the end-to-end service, not only the app download.

---

## 16. Competition / alternatives

- **Professionals** (manual, higher cost).
- **Canva** (and similar) — to be checked for overlap; differentiation on **quality** and **value** for property use case.

---

## 17. The hard bit

- **Competition** from non–real estate players (e.g. Google, Canva).
- **Speed to market** — win fast, prove value, consider exit.
- **Scarcity:** RPMs lack time/skills; agents often won’t invest effort — product must be **fast and low-friction**.
